This is the DogGenerator Image Generator App. The folder 'dogGenerator_app' contains the source code files, written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is a project I built in my second year of studies as a fun way to learn and practice integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s a simple yet interactive app that generates AI-powered dog images based on user prompts, making the experience both entertaining and educational.

Key features:
  - User-friendly interface built with CSS gradients, shadow effects and rounded corners for a smooth and visually appealing experience
  - Uses OpenAI's DALL-E API to dynamically fetch and display generated dog images from validated user prompts
